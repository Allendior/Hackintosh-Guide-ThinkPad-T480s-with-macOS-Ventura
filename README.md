1. Mount the EFI partition of your macOS drive using tools like **MountEFI** or **OpenCore Configurator**.
2. Copy the EFI folder from your USB to the mounted EFI partition on the macOS drive.
3. Reboot your system and select the macOS drive in your BIOS boot menu as the primary boot option.  
4. For detailed guidance, refer to the Dortania guide:
